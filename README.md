# KingBot-Java
KingBot Java Edition is a ground-up rewrite of KingBot in Java using the JDA 4.2.0 library. KingBot Java Edition makes full use of the Object Oriented paradigm, arranging its commands as object implementations of a command interface. KingBot also uses multithreading to accomplish tasks either not possible or not convenient in KingBot's original Javascript implementation.

## Release
KingBot is developed and compiled in Eclipse, and as such I have no current guide for compiling KingBot yourself, other than to suggest opening the project in eclipse and exporting it as a runnable jar. A release jar & accompanying data files may be found on the GitHub page https://github.com/Sher0193/KingBot-Java/releases.
